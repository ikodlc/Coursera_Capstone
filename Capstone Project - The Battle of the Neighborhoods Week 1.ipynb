Singapore is widely regarded as the easiest city in Asia for expats to fit into and it allows foreigners an opportunity to become acquainted with different cultures in a relatively safe and modern environment.\n\nSingapore is an efficient and clean Asian city that retains much of the charm from its British colonial days whilst also offering a cutting edge, well-developed environment. Singapore\u2019s position on the southern tip of Malaysia has allowed it to develop into one of the most important trade and finance centers in Asia and today it is the fifth wealthiest country in the world according to GDP. It also has the fourth largest foreign exchange trading center in the world.\n\nSingapore\u2019s population of 5.69 million people (September 2020) largely consist of people of Chinese (70%), Malay and Indian backgrounds. The main religions followed in Singapore are Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and Tao.\n\nWhile Singapore does offer a high standard of living, it is also one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. Expatriates will find that property prices are very high (whether to rent or buy), alcohol is also taxed at a high rate, and it is also costly to own a car due to the heavy taxes that are imposed on vehicles.\n\nHowever, due to its authoritarian state, expats will find that food and groceries are quite reasonable and public transportation is efficient and orderly."

Locations near commercial real estate areas (malls, cafes, groceries, etc.)\n2. Locations near transportation hubs (MRT, buses, etc.)\n3. Slightly lower rental prices\n\nThese factors were chosen to ensure a higher chance of cost-savings and sustainability when moving to Singapore."

We will be using a dataset of Median Rentals of Private Non-Landed Residential Properties by Name from the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which shows the median rent per sqm per month to get an estimate of rental prices of different housing building locations around Singapore.\n3. We will use the Foursquare API to obtain a list of commercial real estate and transportation hubs in each district around Singapore."
